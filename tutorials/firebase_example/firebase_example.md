# Understanding the `firebase_core` example

In this tutorial we will go through the example
app in the `firebase_core` plugin.
You can find the example (here)[https://github.com/flutter/plugins/tree/master/packages/firebase_core/example].

The example app shows a button and displays the number
of times that button is pressed. As the button
is pressed, the app records two things
into a Firebase database:

1. The number of times the button is pressed. In the database we are storing an integer
2. A message based on the number of times the button is pressed. In the database we are storing a string.

## Create Firebase database

Before we run the program we should setup our development
environment. We need to make sure to sign up to
firebase by going to https://firebase.google.com/ and 
click Get Started. Follow the instructions to creating a account. Once you created an account, we need to make a database.

To create a database click 'Add Project.' then 
you need to add an app. In our case, we will click
"Add Firebase to your Android app".

Now goto your `lib/android/app/src/main/java/com/example/appname/MainActivity.java` and copy the string 
next to the `package` declaration. For example
`package com.example.firebaseexample;`

The `com.example.firebaseexample` is the text we will
paste in the firebase "Android package name".

Leave the other fields as-is then click 'Register App'.

In the next screen, you should choose to download 
`google-services.json` and paste that into the
`lib/android/app` directory.

Now you'll want to configure your gradle files.
Change the `build.gradle`

##### `android/build.gradle`


##### `android/app/build.gradle`

## Setup

There are three general steps involved in using the Firebase API. 
The first general step, is to instantiate the `FirebaseApp` class.
You have to in two parameters to `FirebaseApp`: the name (which can
be anything you), and an options object defined by `FirebaseOptions` class. 

After the setup, we create the child reference which is a
reference to the collection of JSON documents (e.g. `{'foo':bar}`).

Since we want the counter to increment when we press a button,
we associate the button with a callback called `_increment`.

In the `_increment` method, we need to sync to the database
and run the increment logic.
To maintan syncing to the database, we will then setup a firebase stream callback using the `listen` method. Inside the callback, need
to set to zero if necessary. To put the increment logic
in callback for `runTransaction` method. 

The other variable that we need handle is the `_messageRef` database variable which we'll use to record the message that will be displayed. The message string will look something like: 'hello world 1'. All
the logic to recording the message also inside the `_increment` method.

You'll notice that we record to the database in two different ways.
For `_counter` we use the method `runTransaction`, but for
the message we use `_messageRef.push().ref()` and we
pass in a Map type e.g. tk.
