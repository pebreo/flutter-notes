# A Chat Room App using Flutter and Django-Channels (websockets)

In this tutorial, I will show you how to create a
simple chat application using Django Channels and Flutter for Android.
The concepts you will learn in this tutorial will be:

* Websockets in Django
* Serializing JSON from Django
* Serializing JSON from Flutter
* Sending a websocket messaging using StreamBuilder
* Refreshing the Flutter builder using `setState((){})`

For this tutorial, I will assume you have you development
environment already set up.

## Client

We will use the 

#### The pages involved

#### websocket connection

#### json communication



## Server

#### The views involved



#### The routes involved

Channels routing is similar to URLs routing in Django. 
If you need to use the url parameters in your consumer methods, 
you can use `tk`. 


#### `consumers.py`

Each class is a `tk` and within each class you must define
three methods: connect, disconnect, tk.
